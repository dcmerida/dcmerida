# 👋 Hi, I'm Dani

I'm **Daniel Mérida Cordero**, a passionate and curious **Junior Software Developer** currently working at [Kyndryl](https://www.kyndryl.com). I recently graduated from [ITIC BCN](https://agora.xtec.cat/iticbcn/), where I completed a **Higher National Diploma in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM)**, gaining the skills and knowledge necessary to build mobile, web and backend applications.

## 👨‍💻 About me

I enjoy designing and developing software solutions that combine functionality and simplicity. My background includes building Android apps in Kotlin, developing and deploying RESTful APIs, working with relational and non-relational databases, and recently, diving into cloud and data processing technologies.

During my internship at [Kyndryl](https://www.kyndryl.com), I worked as a **Data Scientist**, and I’ve had the opportunity to stay on the team as a full-time developer. This experience has allowed me to explore the world of cloud computing, data ingestion, orchestration pipelines, and artificial intelligence applied in real environments.

My current focus is to deepen my skills in full-stack development, cloud-native architectures, and AI integration, while continuing to grow as a developer through hands-on experience and continuous learning.
